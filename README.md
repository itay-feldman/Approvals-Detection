# Approvals-Detection
Exercise regarding Web3 Approval Detection with ERC-20 Token Standard

The solution focuses mainly on the principles that are (very) new to me, namely:
* Working with Web3 in general and using web3py specifically
* Working with a blockchain
* Working with the Ethereum network and smart contracts
Because of that some of the code might be quick and dirty since I prioritized progressing to next stages over making the code overly clean and wrapping everything nicely, which - if taken to the extreme - would have taken quite a while in my opinion.
